## Internals

### Configuration

All virtual machines and containers are configured via environment
variables. Sensitive information is store encrypted in this repository
using the `secure` R package (https://github.com/hadley/secure). The
process of passing on this information to the virtual machines and
containers is as follows:
1. The package decprypt the configuration information using
   `secure::decrypt`.
2. It sets up environment variables based on this, in a temporary shell,
   to start the virtual machines via Vagrant.
3. Vagrant picks up these environment variables, and sets them in the
   virtual machine.
4. The script that starts a Docker container and/or manages Dokku,
   transfers the needed environment variables into the container(s).
